        What has a higher concentration of contamination, the foot rest/foot plate or arm pads/hand rims?
    </div>
    <div class="collapse-content"> 
      <p>Although the footrests/footplate is basically covered by the feet, and usually left untouched, the arm pads and hand rims share a great deal more of contamination from the hands alone because of such frequent use. We use our hands for many things. Throughout a full day, our hands are subject to more contaminates that are being transferred to arm pads/hand rims than the foot rest area.</p>

        Where does all of that dirt that looks like a fine powdery grit on my chair come from?
    </div>
    <div class="collapse-content"> 
      <p>Believe it or not, that fine powdery grit that you speak of is probably a build up of common house dust. Most common "house dust" found in homes is made up from mostly dead skin flakes that we all shed daily-- along with other additional household debris.</p>

        Is it safe to have a hole in my seat upholstery/cushion if I don’t mind it?
    </div>
    <div class="collapse-content"> 
      <p>Before you say you don’t mind, a simple hole could have great potential to host and hide insects or worse. In the long run, it can only be safe for sheltering unwanted pests. I would have to say no.</p>

        Is rusting really as bad as they say on my equipment?
    </div>
    <div class="collapse-content"> 
      <p>Rust is the visible signs of some type of metal alloy starting to deteriorate. This can be an issue with upholding your equipment's true weight capacity, proper operation, or even the potential of scratching and infecting human skin while transferring to and from a chair.</p>

        What causes my scooter seat to have abrasions on the sides causing tears in it? Tape does not seem to help, it only collects more dirt.
    </div>
    <div class="collapse-content"> 
      <p>Look behind the seat of your scooter. While tracing the armrests in back, you should find two adjustment knobs to extend the width of the arms (there is one for each arm). Loosen these knobs and extend arms away from the scooter, until your back Support can fold forward easily. Re tighten adjustment knobs. [*note some models fold forward by moving an additional lever] It’s actually the arm pads that are causing the damage to the seat. This should fix the problem.</p>

        How long will it take to clean my chair?
    </div>
    <div class="collapse-content"> 
      <p>This solely depends on the condition it is in. A severely neglected power wheelchair may take ninety plus minutes, while a manual wheelchair used infrequently may only take well under twenty-five minutes. We only ask that you not be seated in your chair during the cleaning process. Please reserve the allotted time for your cleaning in advance. This will help both of us.</p>

        What will you use to clean my scooter?
    </div>
    <div class="collapse-content"> 
      <p>This depends on exactly what type of cleaning solvent is needed to get positive results. However there are many different reputable cleaning solvents to choose from that may work, we use in addition to these the same cleaning solvents that are approved for many Dentists, Physicians and EMS personnel.</p>
